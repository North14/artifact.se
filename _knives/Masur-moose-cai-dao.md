This 'Cai Dao' or Chinese vegetable cleaver, is made using repurposed and grinded sawmill blade for the steel. The handle was originally a rounded apple wood, but was replaced after it cracked during drying. The replaced handle is a combination of moose antler and birch masure in a wa-handle design for a Scandinavian touch.

### **Materials & Construction**
- **Handle:** Moose antler bolster, birch masure
- **Blade:** Large blade for chopping and slicing vegetables, poultry and fish
- **Use:** Medium weight, simple, and functional  

Essential and versatile kitchen knife. Most used and functional knife I own.
