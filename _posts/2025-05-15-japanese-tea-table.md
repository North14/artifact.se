# **A Japanese-Style Tea Table**  

In the spirit of wabi-sabi—simplicity, imperfection, and nature—I built this small tea table. Low to the ground, free of ornament, it invites calm.  

It’s not traditional in every sense, but it’s built with respect for the form. Clean joinery, minimal hardware, and natural wood tones.

## **Design Philosophy**  

- **Minimal height** – Designed for floor seating, meditation, or casual tea.  
- **Solid wood** – The grain remains visible, untreated or lightly oiled.  
- **Quiet presence** – Nothing screams for attention. It simply exists in the room.  

I didn’t want it to be a centerpiece—just a part of the space, holding space.

## **Crafting the Table**  

Each step of the build was guided by hand and eye. I avoided screws where possible, relying on dowels, glue, and friction. The table was assembled slowly over a few evenings.

## **Simplicity in Use**  

I didn’t build it for display—I built it to use. For tea. For writing. For moments of pause.  

Would you enjoy something like this in your space? Minimal furniture, with presence but no noise?

Let me know what you think.  

Until next time,
