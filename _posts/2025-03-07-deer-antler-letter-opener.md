# **A Letter Opener with a Story**  

A letter opener is a small thing. It doesn’t need to be forged in fire or tempered in oil. But even in its simplicity, craftsmanship matters.  

This one, shaped from **deer antler and birch masur**, carries a story of nature, time, and tradition—captured in the quiet remains of an abandoned sawmill.

## **Materials: A Bond Between Nature and Craft**  

- **Deer Antler** – A material shaped by time, polished by wind and weather before finding its way into my hands.  
- **Birch Masur** – The swirling grain of masur birch adds a depth that makes each handle unique.  
- **Brass** – A single plate between the two, a small but meaningful detail that ties it all together.  

Each element has its own texture, its own history. Bringing them together is about more than just assembly—it's about creating something that feels alive in your hand.

## **The Photoshoot: An Echo of the Past**  

The sawmill stands still now, its machines silent. Once, it was a place where wood was shaped by human hands, much like this letter opener. The contrast between craftsmanship then and now makes it the perfect setting.

## **A Tool with Purpose**  

A knife, even a letter opener, is more than its edge. It's the way it fits in your hand, the weight of it, the story it carries. This one speaks of the forest, of the past, of the beauty found in simple things.  

Would you use a handcrafted letter opener, or do you prefer something more modern? Let me know in the comments.  

Until next time,
