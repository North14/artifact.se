# My ~~Schizopost~~ Philosophy of Life
1. [Virtue and Roles](#virtue-roles)
2. [The self, the soul and the nature](#self)
3. [Self actualization](#actualization)
4. [Finding Meaning and Purpose](#meaning)
5. [Psychedelics](Psychedelics)


My main inspirations for my current view of life comes from Marcus Aurelius and Albert Camus. Other notable figures that have influenced my ideas are Mark Manson, Jordan Peterson, Ralph Waldo Emerson, Hunter S. Thompson, Lucius Annaeus Seneca.

I used to have a very nihilistic and existentialist view of life. My, then, philosophy was based on the belief that life is meaningless and everyone is living in misery, enduring their past traumas. I did not believe in the meaning or pursuit of anything really, and lived what would mostly be considered a hedonistic lifestyle, pursuing pleasure rather than meaning and purpose.

My journey of philosophy started changing upon further reflection. My perspective got influenced by works of Albert Camus and Victor Frankl. I started believing in the pursuit of meaning in an inherently meaningless world. The world is chaotic and suffering, however within that, one may find its purpose. We need to accept the world as it is, and choose to pursue the suffering we feel brings us meaning.

I am also drawn to the Taoist ideas of Alan Watts. There is one idea in particular that I often ponder upon. What is the meaning of dancing? Alan Watts sees the same way as the meaning of dancing is the dance itself, the meaning of life to be the living itself. There is no destination, there is nothing to accomplish, it isn't a journey. But rather it is an act that is done for the sake of doing.

## Virtue and Roles <a name="virtue-roles"></a>
I believe in the sake of roles within life and society. Some are chosen arbitrarily, some are imposed from society, some are from our biology. For me personally, I am a man, I am human, a brother, a friend, a scholar, a teacher, a researcher, an artist, an IT-expert. We impose these roles by choosing what we are working towards, and what virtues we are living in accordance to. One should always ask oneself; *does what I am doing at this current moment, help me achieve what I am working towards fulfilling?*

I think the biggest proof of roles are from the polarity of male and female. These are involuntary roles, that we have, which we must fulfill. The roles come from nature and biology, but are extrapolated in human modern society, and influenced by the cultural differences.

Morality is found from within where intuition acts as the guidance for having the right thoughts and actions. Virtue and roles are the manifestation of morality through 
Whether virtue and roles are the meaning of life, or just a guidance for finding a meaningful life, is still a question I have yet to answered.

## The self, the soul and the nature
One of my earlier readings and understandings on the self was from naturalism where the idea is of separating the world in the soul and the nature, or the 'rest'. The nature is the mirroring of the soul. This never fully made sense to me, . While people may act as a mirror of oneself in certain scenarios, I merely think this is a mirror of ones lens, not a transcendence of the soul. 

Who am I? Non-self? Non-duality? 
## Self actualization <a name="actualization"></a>
I believe self actualization is the work of aligning your purpose, virtues and roles, towards what you are doing at this current moment. Self actualization is not a state, rather a continuous work, 

Jordan Peterson offers a practical way to self actualization. He expresses we grow up by fulfilling our roles. We choose our career and pursue our purpose by taking on responsibility.

## Finding Meaning and Purpose <a name="meaning"></a>
For finding meaning and purpose in life, I think the advice from Hunter S. Thompson's letter offers practical ways to
	Choose a way of life, not a pre-defined goal. The goal is secondary, the functioning towards the goal is primary.
	"Make the goal conform to the individual, rather than make the individual conform to the goal"
	["As I see it then, the formula runs something like this: a man must choose a path which will let his ABILITIES function at maximum efficiency toward the gratification of his DESIRES."](https://fs.blog/hunter-s-thompson-to-hume-logan/)
	["who is the happier man, he who has braved the storm of life and lived or he who has stayed securely on shore and merely existed?"](http://ram.org/contrib/security.html)

Mark Manson and Jordan Peterson has expressed this idea of choosing our struggles. I do not believe the chosen struggle is what will bring meaning and purpose to life. However I do believe it can be used as a tool for finding ones purpose. Consider what you are willing to sacrifice to achieve the roles you find for yourself. Do you want to be an artist? Are you willing to live a bohemian lifestyle, struggling to make ends make meet for the sake of expressing yourself? Do you want to be a scholar? Are you willing to put in the stress and hours to achieve that? Consider what is within your abilities.

> "The struggle itself towards the heights is enough to fill a man's heart. We must imagine Sisyphus happy." -- Albert Camus

## Psychedelics <a name="Psychedelics"></a>
Psychedelics have been a significant factor in my understanding of the universe. Apart from a greater understanding of myself in the form of revealing my values, granting me a new perception, and enhancing my emotions; psychedelics have increased my understanding of the universe. Some of the most significant epiphanies I will discuss here.

We are often times living our lives in accordance with patterns. These patterns are often formed at a young age, and we are in a state of cruise control. We think these are strict patterns whom may not change. But they are not, through mindfulness we can enact free will without mindlessly going with the flow.

Apart from the patterns of self, there is a larger pattern of the universe. Life events are just the patterns of individuals and nature playing out. Synchronicity

Another state which had a big impact on me is the 
ego death
Existing without existing
	State where you exist without a sense of self
		What is the soul?
			The observer
