# My ~~Schizopost~~ Philosophy of Life
1. [Virtue and Roles](#virtue-roles)
2. [The self, the soul and the nature](#self)

My journey through philosophy and spirituality has changed throughout my life. Starting with nihilistic view of life, to psychedelics, to naturalism and , to stoicism, to buddhism.

My main inspirations for my current view of life comes from Marcus Aurelius and Albert Camus. Other notable figures that have influenced my ideas are Mark Manson, Jordan Peterson, Ralph Waldo Emerson, Hunter S. Thompson, Lucius Annaeus Seneca.

I used to have a very nihilistic and existentialist view of life. My, then, philosophy was based on the belief that life is meaningless and everyone is living in misery, enduring their past traumas. I did not believe in the meaning or pursuit of anything really, and lived what would mostly be considered a hedonistic lifestyle, pursuing pleasure rather than meaning and purpose.
