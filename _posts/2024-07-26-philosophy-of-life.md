# My Philosophy of Life
1. [Virtue and Roles](#virtue-roles)
2. [The self, the soul and the nature](#self)
3. [Self actualization](#actualization)
4. [Finding Meaning and Purpose](#meaning)


My main inspirations for my current view of life comes from Marcus Aurelius and Albert Camus. Other notable figures that have influenced my ideas are Mark Manson, Jordan Peterson, Ralph Waldo Emerson, Hunter S. Thompson, Lucius Annaeus Seneca.

I used to have a very nihilistic and existentialist view of life. My, then, philosophy was based on the belief that life is meaningless and everyone is living in misery, enduring themselves and their traumas. I did not believe in the meaning or pursuit of anything really, and lived what would mostly be considered a hedonistic lifestyle, pursuing pleasure rather than meaning and purpose.

My journey of philosophy started changing upon further reflection. My perspective got influenced by works of Albert Camus and Victor Frankl. Albert Camus in his writings paint this picture of how life is absurd. The absurd is the pursuit of meaning in an inherently meaningless world. The world is chaotic and suffering, and trying to make sense of it is futile. However within that, one may find its purpose. We need to accept the world as it is, and choose to pursue the suffering we feel brings us meaning.

I am also drawn to the Taoist ideas of Alan Watts. There is one idea in particular that I often ponder upon. What is the meaning of dancing? Alan Watts sees the same way as the meaning of dancing is the dance itself, the meaning of life to be the living itself. There is no destination, there is nothing to accomplish, it isn't a journey. But rather it is an act that is done for the sake of doing.

## Virtue and Roles <a name="virtue-roles"></a>
I believe in the sake of roles within life and society. Some are chosen arbitrarily, some are imposed from society, some are from our biology. For me personally, I am a man, I am human, a brother, a friend, a scholar, a teacher, a researcher, an artist, an IT-expert. We impose these roles by choosing what we are working towards, and what virtues we are living in accordance to. One should always ask oneself; *does what I am doing at this current moment, help me achieve what I am working towards fulfilling?*

I think the biggest proof of roles are from the polarity of male and female. These are involuntary roles, that we have, which we must fulfill. The roles come from nature and biology, but are extrapolated in human modern society, and influenced by the cultural differences.

Morality is found from within where intuition acts as the guidance for having the right thoughts and actions. Virtue and roles are the manifestation of morality through 
Whether virtue and roles are the meaning of life, or just a guidance for finding a meaningful life, is still a question I have yet to answered.

## The self, the soul and the nature
One of my earlier readings and understandings on the self was from naturalism where the idea is of separating the world in the soul and the nature, or the 'rest'. The nature is the mirroring of the soul. This never fully made sense to me. While people may act as a mirror of oneself in certain scenarios, I merely think this is a mirror of ones lens, not a transcendence of the soul.

In Buddhism, the Buddha explains the self as rather a non-self, *anatman*. There are multiple explanations for what this means but the one I have heard and makes the most sense to me is that when the Buddha says there is no self, there isn't a concrete self to exist which may be grasped. What we refer to as self in terms of physical, is just our body. What we refer to as self in terms of description, "I am this, I am that", is just our ego. What we refer to as self in terms of emotional state, is just that, emotions. Just the same, our thoughts are just that, thoughts.

From my writing you may understand a hint of skepticism. The Buddhist idea of self as non-self has been the most convincing I have heard, but there is still a state of ambiguity in me. The state of ego-death, which is further described below makes this rather convincing. Experiencing ego-death, reveals there is a state of where you do not exist.

Additionally the Taoist idea of non-duality should be considered, where the idea is that the internal world and the external world are the same. Further contemplation is necessary on this though.
## Self actualization <a name="actualization"></a>
> ["Who is the happier man, he who has braved the storm of life and lived or he who has stayed securely on shore and merely existed?"](http://ram.org/contrib/security.html) -- Hunter S. Thompson

I believe self actualization is the work of aligning your purpose, virtues and roles, towards what you are doing at this current moment. Self actualization is not a state, rather a continuous work.

Jordan Peterson offers a practical way to self actualization. He expresses growth as fulfilling ones roles. We pursue this by choosing our career and choose a purpose by taking on responsibility. While Petersons ideas are strongly perceived by his christian influence, myself do not believe in the importance of such ideas. For example, Peterson argues for the importance of traditional values such as the core family and becoming a powerful/respectful person. Myself am more open to the ideas of radical lifestyles such as devoting oneself to art.

## Finding Meaning and Purpose <a name="meaning"></a>
Now, how does one find such meaning and purpose in life then? I think the advice from Hunter S. Thompson's letter offers practical ways to craft a persons life in that way. Thompson argues that one should choose a way of life, not a pre-defined goal. The goal is secondary, the functioning towards the goal is what is primary. This goal should be chosen based on the individual, not that the individual should conform towards the goal. Self reflection is key in this process to understand ones place and abilities in shaping a way.

Mark Manson and Jordan Peterson has expressed this idea of choosing our struggles. I do not believe the chosen struggle is what will bring meaning and purpose to life. However I do believe it can be used as a tool for finding ones purpose. Consider what you are willing to sacrifice to achieve the roles you find for yourself. Do you want to be an artist? Are you willing to live a bohemian lifestyle, struggling to make ends make meet for the sake of expressing yourself? Do you want to be a scholar? Are you willing to put in the stress and hours to achieve that? Consider what is within your abilities. This thought process aligns with the meaning of Thompson, where self reflection can lead one to finding what is within ones abilities.
