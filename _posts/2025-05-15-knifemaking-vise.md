# **A Simple Vise for Knifemaking**  

Sometimes, the simplest tools become the most essential. This vise was built with only what was on hand—scrap metal, a few bolts, and a vision. It's not perfect, but it works. And more importantly, it lets me work.

## **Built to Fit the Workbench**  

Made to fit the exact height of my bench, it holds blades for polishing, shaping, and refining. It’s made of salvaged steel and wood, welded and bolted with a touch of stubbornness.  

- **Adjustable clamp** – to hold all kinds of blade shapes  
- **Height-matched base** – for comfort and ergonomics  
- **Raw finish** – no paint, no polish—just utility

This isn’t a tool you’d find in a catalogue. It’s shaped by need.

## **In the Workshop**  

Each image tells a part of the process: from the first welds to testing the grip. It’s not glamorous, but it works.

## **Form Follows Function**  

There’s something rewarding about using tools you’ve made yourself. They don’t just serve a purpose—they remind you of what your hands are capable of.

Would you build your own tools, or do you prefer factory precision? Let me know your thoughts.

Until next time,
