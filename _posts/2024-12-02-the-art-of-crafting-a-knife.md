### The Art of Crafting a Knife

When you hold a handcrafted knife in your hand, you’re not just holding a tool—you’re holding a story. At **Artifact**, we believe that every blade we forge is a bridge between timeless tradition and modern needs. In today’s post, I’d like to take you behind the scenes into the process of crafting one of our knives.

#### **Step 1: Choosing the Steel**
The journey begins with the right steel. Whether it’s high-carbon steel for a razor-sharp edge or stainless steel for durability, the material dictates the blade's performance. We always aim for the perfect balance between hardness and flexibility.

#### **Step 2: Forging the Blade**
This is where the magic happens. The steel is heated to over 1,000°C and hammered into shape. Each strike is purposeful, shaping not just the blade but also its soul. This stage combines precision and raw energy—a hallmark of blacksmithing.

#### **Step 3: Heat Treatment**
Heat treatment is the key to a knife’s strength. By carefully heating and quenching the blade, we achieve a fine balance between hardness and toughness. This process is where science meets art, requiring both knowledge and intuition.

#### **Step 4: Grinding and Polishing**
Once the blade is hardened, it’s time to grind it to its final shape. This step ensures the knife has the sharpness and profile needed for its purpose, whether it’s slicing through wood or preparing a meal in the great outdoors.

#### **Step 5: Crafting the Handle**
The handle transforms the blade into a tool you can trust. At Artifact, we use natural materials like wood, antler, and leather, each chosen for its durability and unique aesthetic. Shaping and attaching the handle is where individuality shines—no two knives are ever the same.

### **The Knife as a Companion**
A well-crafted knife isn’t just a tool; it’s a companion on your adventures, a reflection of your connection to nature and craftsmanship. At Artifact, our goal is to create knives that are as beautiful as they are functional, designed to last a lifetime.
